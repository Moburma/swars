Major items:
• Network/multiplayer
• Tension music support

Less important items:
• Joystick support
• Fix policemen attacking you when you right-click with your weapons hidden
  when near a policeman
• Check the timing so that the mouse is updated 30fps, the screen at ~22fps and
  the sound at how many it requires to play loops without crackling but also
  smoothly modulate pitch for weapons that use it
• Add some sort of sleep call to movie playback (atm they do busy waiting)

Far future:
• Re-write the game in C?
